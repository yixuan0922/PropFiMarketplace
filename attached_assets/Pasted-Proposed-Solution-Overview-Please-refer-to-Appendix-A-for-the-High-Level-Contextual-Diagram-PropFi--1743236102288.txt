Proposed Solution
Overview
Please refer to Appendix A for the High Level Contextual Diagram. PropFi is a centralized digital marketplace created to facilitate fractional property ownership by bringing together property developers, prospective homeowners, and investors. While investors can participate in real estate appreciation free from the weight of complete property ownership, homeowners have the chance to buy a house without making a full upfront payment.
Property developers can now tokenize and offer new homes projects utilizing PropFi, therefore enabling buyers to buy a minimum 55% ownership of a property. This addresses the root causes of high down payments and monthly repayments as the loan sum is drastically reduced. Since the loan sum is lower, it increases the chances of securing a loan as the risk is much lower. This addresses the strict lending requirements root cause. The remaining 45% is made available for investors to acquire. Investors might decide to make passive rental income by investing in fully rented-out properties or in homes occupied by homeowners and gain from market appreciation. All transactions, including property token sales, rental payments, and ownership transfers, will be facilitated by the PropFi platform, ensuring a secure, automated, and transparent real estate investment process. 
How PropFi Works
4.2.1 Property Listing & Initial Purchase
Tokenized and listed for sale on the PropFi, property developers will let prospective homeowners (occupiers) search and buy at least 55% ownership of any one property. The remaining is then sold to investors. Once a property is fully allocated, ownership is secured and recorded within the PropFi platform. This approach enables homeowners to obtain residence with a lesser down payment and mortgage, while investors can diversify their real estate holdings. PropFi will enable a partial sale of token holderâ€™s shares to the market, lowering their ownership in the event that they have outstanding payments to the PropFi. To address the root cause of competition from corporations, only individuals who are citizens or permanent residents are eligible to purchase the majority ownership. 
4.2.2 Minimum Ownership Requirement & Rent Mechanism
Once ownership is distributed, the occupier with above 55% ownership is granted full residency rights and does not need to pay rent. Occupiers with the intention of starting small owning less than 55% are required to pay rent proportional to the investor-owned percentage of the property. To ensure affordability, occupants who fall below the 55% ownership threshold will receive a partial refund on their rent payments, based on their current ownership stake. This mechanism enables occupants to progressively move towards full ownership while ensuring that they pay less than they would if renting a comparable property elsewhere. For example, if a property's market rent is $2,000 per month and the occupier owns 50%, they would pay $1,000 in rent. However, since they own half of the property, they receive a $500 refund, meaning their actual net rent payment is only $500. This system guarantees that investors continue to receive returns on their ownership while offering financial freedom and lessening the burden of renting. Any form of rental income is collected by PropFi and automatically distributed to the respective token holders. 
4.2.3 Buying, Selling and Owning Property Tokens
Investors who own property tokens can either hold their investment and benefit from market appreciation or trade their tokens in the PropFi Marketplace. They can choose to invest in properties that have occupiers, where they profit from appreciation, or they can invest in fully rented-out properties to receive passive rental income. Collective actions like rental, sale etc require votes and will be executed based on token majority. Occupiers looking to increase their ownership will purchase tokens directly from investors at market price. When investors list their tokens for sale, they are reserved for a week, allowing the occupier to have priority in purchasing additional shares before they are made available to the public. This enables occupiers to gradually increase their ownership in small increments, like buying an additional 10% instead of being forced into a lump-sum purchase. Over time, this process allows them to transition to full homeownership at their own pace while maintaining financial flexibility.
How PropFi works in Practice
4.3.1 Case Study: Alex, an Aspiring Homeowner
Despite his desire to purchase his first home, 28-year-old engineer Alex lacks the funds necessary for a down payment. But through PropFi, he is able to own a majority stake in a home without needing to commit to 100% upfront ownership. His financial barrier to homeownership is significantly reduced because he only needs to make a 55% down payment rather than 100% of the home's cost. Alex looks through the PropFi Marketplace and discovers a $600,000 condo that a real estate firm has listed. He decides to purchase 55% ownership for $330,000, while investors purchase the remaining 45% as property-backed tokens. Since Alex owns at least 55%, he has full residency rights and does not need to pay rent.
Alex lost his job a few years after buying his house and could not keep up with mortgage payments. To cover his outstanding payments, PropFi facilitates a partial sale of his shares to investors, which dropped his ownership from 55% to 45%. As he now owns less than 55% of the house, he lost his full residency rights and has to pay rent on the part he does not own PropFi consults internal property valuators to determine the market rent for the area, ensuring that rental payments align with fair market value. The rent collected is distributed to investors proportionally through the PropFi platform.
After six months, Alex finds a new job and stabilizes his finances. He decides to repurchase some of his lost ownership shares, increasing his stake back to 55%. This permits him to reclaim his full resident rights, eliminating the need to pay rent again. Over time, he continues to buy more tokens, eventually towards a full ownership of his home. This illustrates how PropFi offers a flexible homeownership model that lets occupiers modify their ownership in accordance with their financial situation, guarantees that investors keep making money, and gives homeowners the chance to eventually retake control of their property.
4.4.     Benefits for Key Stakeholders
4.4.1 Benefits for Aspiring Homeowners (Occupiers)
PropFi allows homeowners to enter the property market without requiring a full down payment or a large mortgage. Occupiers benefit from an affordable pathway to homeownership, paying only a portion of the property's cost while still having residency rights. The ability to progressively buy more ownership makes the journey to full homeownership financially sustainable, and the rent reimbursement mechanism guarantees that occupiers with less than 55% pay much less than they would have if they were renting elsewhere.
4.4.2 Benefits for Investors
Investors can participate in real estate appreciation without the traditional risks and costs associated with full property ownership. They have the option of investing in fully rented-out properties to provide passive rental income or in occupied properties to profit from long-term appreciation. The PropFi Marketplace's token trading feature guarantees that investors have liquidity and may exit their investments anytime.
4.4.3 Benefits for Property Developers
PropFi allows real estate developers to reach a larger pool of prospective clients, including those who might not have the funds to pay for full ownership up front. This results in faster sales, increased liquidity, and a more diverse customer base. Additionally, the fractional ownership model ensures that properties are fully allocated and maintained, reducing the risk of unsold inventory.
